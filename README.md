APCSA Survival Simulator Project

Description: Our project will allow a user to expeirence 
their own survival experience. From being a scavenger to 
a medic to a warrior, which each have unique features, the 
user will be allowed the option to select what they want 
to be. There will be a selection of weapons the user can 
find and use to help defend themselves through 10 nights 
of zombie waves. Aside from defending themselves the user
 will also be tasked with maintaining their energy, health, 
 and happiness at a safe level.
