### Zombie Apocalypse
#### _67thStreetKids_

  Description: 
This project allows users to experience their own survival journey in a zombie-infested world. Players can choose from multiple character roles—Scavenger, Medic, or Warrior—each with unique abilities and gameplay mechanics.

As the game progresses, users must search for weapons and resources to defend themselves during increasingly difficult waves of zombies. In addition to combat, players are responsible for managing their energy, health, and happiness levels to survive as long as possible.

This project combines strategy, resource management, and role-based gameplay to create an engaging survival experience.

  Features:
Multiple playable character classes with unique abilities
Weapon selection system for combat and defense
Zombie wave survival mechanics
Player stat management (health, energy, happiness)
Role-based gameplay encouraging strategic decisions

  How the Code Works:
The program uses separate classes for each character role (Scavenger, Medic, Warrior)
Shared behaviors are implemented using inheritance
Player stats and inventory are stored using arrays or ArrayLists
Classes interact to manage combat, resource usage, and survival mechanics

  How to Run the Program:
Compile all project files
Run the main driver class
Select a character role when prompted
Follow on-screen instructions to survive zombie waves

  Development Process:
Our team followed an Agile workflow by dividing responsibilities and collaborating through regular progress updates. We focused on creating a balanced survival system while ensuring each role felt unique. Future improvements would include expanded maps, more weapons, and advanced enemy behavior.
